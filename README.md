# CLTCalculator
to calculate how many planks are needed to make a panel and how much timber is needed for a project 

Project still has a way to go 

What it does now: 
1) input for file name
2) input panel thickness 
3) input panel size 1 
4) input panel size 2 

results: 
- planks for each layer 
- timber for each panel 
- writes to an excel document 

Next steps: 
- input number of panels 
- write multiple panels to excel 
- divide total volume by bundle volumes to create order list 

Future : 
- create GUI
